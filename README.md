#####Meet Hal - your friendly SMS-based information engine.

Ever wanted to Google who Alan Turing was, but you can't because your internet bundle's too stingy to let you start a couple of days early? Been on holiday, where learning the capital of Peru over roaming data costs £9.99 plus tax? (It's Lima, by the way.) Or maybe your phone just hasn't been rocketed into the 21st Century yet, and even currency conversion makes it overheat?

***Worry no more - Hal is here to help.***

Hooking into Google Places, Wikipedia, WordsAPI, Google's currency conversion tools and much more coming soon, Hal can get you out of a scrape.
